# Boilerinvaders2.0

This is a little gamedev project where i have been utilizing pygame to recreate my ECE 362 and Spark Challenge project called boilerinvaders

we made the original in embedded C for an ST32 microcontroller, which had many limitations

so i thought I could recreate utilizing pygame and give it a lot more depth
